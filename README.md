# CalPal - The Smart Meeting Scheduler Agent

CalPal is a command-line intelligent scheduling assistant that uses AI agents to parse natural language requests and manage your Google Calendar. Simply tell CalPal what meeting you want to schedule, and it will find a time and book it for you.

## üéØ Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Describe your meeting in plain English (e.g., "Lunch with Alex next Thursday at 1pm").
- **Calendar Integration**: Directly checks your Google Calendar's availability to find a free slot.
- **Automated Scheduling**: Creates calendar events with attendees, topic, and duration automatically.
- **Agent-Based Architecture**: Built using LangChain, showcasing a clear multi-agent workflow.

## ü§ñ How It Works (Agent Architecture)

CalPal uses a system of specialized agents that work together to complete the scheduling task.
